EmuTOS - C256 Foenix GenX 68k version

This version of EmuTOS aims at providing an EmuTOS experience on Steffany
Allaire's C256 Foenix GenX with 68000 or 68EC030 CPU module.

The C256 Foenix (https://www.c256foenix.com) is a "modern retro-computer" which
is the dream machine from the 80/90s. Is inspired by the Commodore 64 but is
not compatible with it and is actually a lot better.
The GenX is the 3rd generation of C256, which has an expansion for a CPU module
card. The 68000 is being designed and the 68EC030 should follow soon after.

Status: 
For now, only the EmuTOS build target is added, as the memory map of the GenX
is not known yet.
For now it builds as 256K ROM because that "should" be enough and it can leave
room in the flash for other things or alternative systems selectable by a
boot selector.
