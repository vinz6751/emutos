 * This is a generic PS/2 mouse driver.. It is notified by on_irq when an interrupt occurred
 * for the device. It quickly stores the received data in a buffer and returns.
 * When the OS allows for more expensive processing to occur, to decode the received data,
 * it calles process(). That method then analyses the buffer and fires the key_up / key_down
 * callbacks from the OS.
