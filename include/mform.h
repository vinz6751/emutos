/* There's a bit of a mess around this structure, which is why it has its own file:
 * The Line A needs to initialize the mouse cursor to some form, by default it's an arrow that is
 * modeled in MFORM format. For this reason, linea_mouse_set_form takes a MFORM. But MFORM is an AES
 * structure so it shouldn't be used in the Line A which is a lower layer...
 * Internally the Line A (for Atari) uses its own MCDB format so it doesn't even care about MFORM.
 * If we wanted the Line A to be standalone, we should then model the arrow in MCDB format, so we can
 * forget about MFORM in Line A.
